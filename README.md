This code aims at implementing the booking of tickets, the live tracking of a bus, showing the eta of a bus to a bus station, and also displaying the route of any bus number. 
for now, the code has been integrated with two pages, the landing/home page, and the bus ticket booking page. 

the landing page has also been accomponied by gsap library, for various animations, completing it. 
the bus tracking page will be updated to show results based on the search query of the user, which again, will have an option to book the ticket.

we are implementing other features with the help of apis, and are adding the backend database using firebase. 
live tracking- idea is to implement live tracking using gps coordinates of the conductor. 
gps coordinates will be fetched using a public api.
bus route- using maps api, we'll plot the route onto the map. eta- we'll caltulate the eta using another public api.
